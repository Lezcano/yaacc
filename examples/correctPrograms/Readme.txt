In these examples everything that the language can do is tested.

The most important and illustrative examples are the following

input3.c	While, if, else, break, continue
input6.c 	Recursive factorial
input7.c	Mutually recursive factorial (prototypes are used)
input10.c	Nested structs
input17.c	For, declaration and use of composite arrays local and global alike.
input19.c	arrays and structs nested recursively.
input20.c	Assignment is a normal expression, you can operate with its result, even assigning it to another variable
input24.c	Integers can be used as booleans
input25.c	Recursive Quicksort (execute it with a stack of 500 units at least)
